## Summary

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks used for the data analysis described in &lqduo;Mechanistic Origin of Superionic Lithium Diffusion in Anion-Disordered Li<sub>6</sub>PS<sub>5</sub><i>X</i> Argyrodites&rdquo; (awaiting DOI).

The dataset contains raw simulation data (VASP XDATCAR files) from a series of <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics simulations on Li<sub>6</sub>PS<sub>5</sub><i>X</i> argyrodites, and Jupyter notebooks containing code to process these data to produce the relevant manuscript figures.

The full DFT dataset, including all DFT inputs and outputs is available at [TODO]().

To run the complete data analysis, run the following commands from the top level directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
snakemake clean
snakemake --cores all
```

## Contents:
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `Snakefile`: The top-level `snakemake` analysis workflow script.
- `system_info.txt`: Information about the runtime environment (e.g. OS version and installed versions of Python packages) used to generate this dataset before depositing.
 here also provide code for plotting the relevent figures.
- `data`: Nested directories containing the raw molecular dynamics trajectory data (as VASP `XDATCAR` files).
- `scripts`: Auxiliary Python scripts.
- `analysis`: Nested directories containing Jupyter notebooks for various analyses of the molecular dynamics data.
- `figures`: Manuscript figures generated by running the analysis workflow.

## Dependencies
The analysis workflow has the following Python module dependencies:
- [crystal-torture](https://pypi.org/project/crystal-torture/)
- [jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/)
- [kinisi](https://pypi.org/project/kinisi/)
- [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [polyhedral_analysis](https://pypi.org/project/polyhedral-analysis/)
- [pymatgen](https://pypi.org/project/pymatgen/)
- [pyyaml](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)
- [site-analysis](https://pypi.org/project/site-analysis/)
- [snakemake](https://pypi.org/project/snakemake/)
- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)
- [version-information](https://pypi.org/project/version_information/)

These can be installed using `pip` via
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Packages can be installed using the &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; versions that were used for the as-published dataset via
```
pip install -r frozen_requirements.txt
```

Note: Installation of [`crystal-torture`](https://crystal-torture.readthedocs.io) requires a Fortran compiler is installed.

Full system information and Python environment used to generate the as-published analysis dataset is listed in [`system_info.txt`](system_info.txt).

## Data processing workflow

Data processing is mostly managed using [`snakemake`](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io), and uses the Jupyter notebooks in the `analysis` directory, and the Python scripts in the `scripts` directory. The full data analysis workflow can be rerun with:
```
snakemake --cores all clean
snakemake --cores all
```
